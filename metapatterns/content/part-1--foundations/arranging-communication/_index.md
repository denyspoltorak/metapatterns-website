# Arranging communication

As a project grows, it tends to become subdivided into services, modules, or whatever you call the components that match its subdomains \(or *bounded contexts*, if you prefer the \[[DDD]({{< relref "../../part-7--appendices/appendix-b--books-referenced.md#ddd" >}})\] convention\)\. Still, there remain system\-wide use cases that require collaboration from many or all of the system’s parts – otherwise the components don’t make a single system\. Let’s see how they can be integrated\.

As integration is not unique to distributed systems – it is present even in smaller programs that need to make data, functions, and classes work together – we’ll take a look at programming and architectural paradigms next\.
