# Appendix A\. Acknowledgements\.

I remember Avraham Fraenkel of DSPG who showed me what a true manager is like\.

Thanks to Alexey Nikitin and Maxim Medvedev of Keenetic who let me design a subsystem from scratch and see how it fared through years of heavy changes\.

It was from discussion with Sergey Ignatchenko aka [IT Hare](http://ithare.com/) that I learned the difference between [control]({{< relref "../part-1--foundations/four-kinds-of-software.md#control-real-time-hardware-input" >}}) and [data processing]({{< relref "../part-1--foundations/four-kinds-of-software.md#computational-single-run-user-input" >}}) systems\. Mark Richards read my [previous series of articles](https://medium.com/itnext/introduction-to-software-architecture-with-actors-part-1-89de6000e0d3) and encouraged me to press on with the classification of patterns\. Kiarash Irandoust noticed [my articles on Medium](https://medium.com/@denyspoltorak) and invited me to publish them in [ITNEXT](https://itnext.io/) where many more people could see them\.

Thanks to Max Grom and other participants of the Ukrainian software architecture chat for hours of heated discussions about the meaning of patterns, which resulted in several analytical chapters of the book and for guiding me through the intricacies of DDD\.

Many thanks to Lars Nood√©n for editing the entire book\.

I must thank my mother and our neighbor Halyna for helping me throughout the war\.

I want to thank everybody who prayed for me\.

This book was made possible by many people who sacrificed their happy years, their limbs and their lives to protect those who stayed behind\.
