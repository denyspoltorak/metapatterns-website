## You’ll find inside

- A structured collection of [architectural patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_pattern) with hundreds of NoUML diagrams\.
- Technology\-agnostic knowledge distilled from a multitude of [sources]({{< relref "../appendices/books-referenced.md" >}})\.
- [Deconstruction](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreDeconstruction) of software architecture into its basic principles\.


## Opentowork

I am looking for a good job\. Embedded or high load C / C\+\+\. B2B from Ukraine\. I can gather a team\.

## This book needs examples

Several readers told me that the patterns and principles should be illustrated with examples of their use in real\-world systems\. I cannot write them on my own because the scope of the book is much wider than my professional experience\.

I am looking for both inline explanations about individual patterns \(see blocks with gray background scattered throughout this book\) and for one or two introductory case studies that will detail internal workings and evolution of complex real\-world software to show how patterns are used in practice and promote the book to the [duplex league](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DuplexBook.html)\.

Please consider sharing your experience as a co\-author of a future version of this book\.
